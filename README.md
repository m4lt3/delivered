# Delivered! - Digital Courier Sheets

## What is "Delivered!"?

Delivered is a solo journaling RPG developed by [Kari Jo "Kage" Freudigmann](https://www.ragekagegames.com/)

## What is this project?

As the name states, this project offers the option to digitally store the courier sheets of the game.

This Project is **not** a digital implementation of "Delivered" and it doesn't aim to be! A lot of work went into the creating of this RPG and fully implementing this and making it available for free online would be piracy.
